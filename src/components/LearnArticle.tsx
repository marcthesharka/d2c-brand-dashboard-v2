      <h2>The Best Gluten-Free Snacks We're Eating in 2025 üç´üå±</h2>

      <p>Any truly gluten-free eater knows the pain: your pantry is full of <em>fruit</em>, <em>hard boiled eggs</em>, <em>hummus</em>‚Ä¶ and maybe some tears. Gluten-free snacking has long been a bleak landscape ‚Äî limited, bland, and definitely not exciting.</p>

      <p>But we‚Äôve got some good news: the new generation of gluten-free snacks has <strong>arrived</strong>, and they're not just compliant ‚Äî they‚Äôre craveable.</p>

      <p>At <strong>D2C Bodega</strong>, we‚Äôve been taste-testing our way through the gluten-free snack aisle (and then some). Here are three standouts we‚Äôre tracking ‚Äî and snacking on ‚Äî right now:</p>

      <h3>ü•ö RXBAR ‚Äî The OG Clean Label Protein Bar</h3>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS0SeLaxFCABNZhxC7APEHzYBlKRTGo9S91oOS6cXrDfgIUiRxqM5kedgMd2xJBM4WK14Y&usqp=CAU" alt="RXBAR" style="max-width:300px;border-radius:0.5rem;margin-bottom:1rem;" />
      <p><strong>üî• Spicy Review:</strong> We stan the Chocolate Sea Salt flavor. It's chewy, rich, and gives "I go to Barry‚Äôs Bootcamp but also forget to grocery shop." Bonus: the egg white protein actually fills you up ‚Äî unlike 99% of other bars pretending to.</p>

      <h3>üí™ David Protein Snacks ‚Äî From the RXBAR Founders (Yes, Really)</h3>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQo9SIaGyxC8lAO4tAXUOCCmZyr-YJBwkFwwg&s" alt="David Protein" style="max-width:300px;border-radius:0.5rem;margin-bottom:1rem;" />
      <p><strong>üî• Spicy Review:</strong> The Peanut Butter Bites slap. Think of them as the glow-up of your childhood protein snacks. You get 10g of protein per serving, and they taste like peanut butter cookie dough with a crunch. We see you, David üëÄ.</p>

      <h3>üå± Mezcla ‚Äî Plant-Based Protein Bars That Actually Taste Good</h3>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRWfdzlXOrTHzy-NkwTEqESKR_y56Gmj9_MIQ&s" alt="Mezcla Bar" style="max-width:300px;border-radius:0.5rem;margin-bottom:1rem;" />
      <p><strong>üî• Spicy Review:</strong> Mezcla‚Äôs packaging and flavors transport you, even if you're stuck at your desk. They're lighter than RXBARs and a bit more crumbly, but we‚Äôre into it. Also: they look amazing on Instagram.</p>

      <h3>TL;DR ‚Äî Gluten-Free Can Slap</h3>
      <p>We get it ‚Äî the gluten-free struggle is real. But brands like RXBAR, David, and Mezcla are rewriting the rules, one bar at a time. Whether you‚Äôre celiac, GF-curious, or just tired of hummus as a main food group, these snacks deliver.</p>

      <p>üì¶ You can find all three brands (and more gluten-free gems) at <a href="https://www.d2cbodega.com">d2cbodega.com</a> ‚Äî where we track the best in D2C food & bev, so you don‚Äôt have to.</p>

      <h2>Intermittent Fasting 16:8: My Honest Review & Why It's a Productivity Game-Changer</h2>
      
      <div style="text-align:center;margin:2rem 0;display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;">
        <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdDVlNnVtNmhpbWl0NjVtMzQwZW42bmQzcW1xa254OGdlenoxMnN1eCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3oEhmCmDzqV12kkwdW/giphy.gif" alt="Hulk Hogan flexing" style="max-width:400px;border-radius:0.5rem;display:block;margin:0 auto;" />
        <div style="font-size:0.95em;color:#64748b;margin-top:0.5rem;">When you're fasting, you become a productivity machine. Brother!</div>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Let me be real with you:</strong> I started 16:8 intermittent fasting on a whim, thinking it was just another health trend. Two years later, it's completely changed how I work, think, and feel. This isn't some generic "fasting is great" article‚Äîthis is my honest experience with the good, the bad, and the surprisingly game-changing benefits.</p>

      <h3>What is 16:8 Intermittent Fasting?</h3>
      <p>16:8 fasting is simple: you eat all your calories within an 8-hour window and fast for 16 hours. For me, that means no food until noon, then eating between 12 PM and 8 PM. That's it. No calorie counting, no complicated meal plans, no expensive supplements.</p>

      <h3>Why I Started (and Why I'm Still Doing It)</h3>
      <p>I was skeptical. The internet is full of fasting "experts" who make it sound like some mystical practice. But here's what actually happened:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning productivity skyrocketed:</strong> My most focused, creative hours are now 8 AM to noon, when I'm just drinking black coffee with nothing digesting in my system.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise on an empty stomach:</strong> I can work out in the morning without feeling sluggish or bloated. It's like my body is primed for movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental clarity:</strong> I feel calmer, more focused, and less distracted by random cravings throughout the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplified eating:</strong> No more "what should I eat for breakfast?" stress. I just don't eat until I'm actually hungry.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Science Behind Why It Works</h3>
      <p>When you're in a fasted state, your body switches from burning glucose to burning fat for energy. But here's the interesting part: your brain also changes how it operates.</p>

      <p><strong>The physiological component:</strong> When you're fasting or in a calorie deficit, your body has fewer resources to waste. It's like your mind goes into "survival mode" and channels all available energy to the most important tasks. No more mental bandwidth for stupid crap‚Äîjust pure focus on what matters.</p>

      <p>Research shows that fasting increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is like fertilizer for your brain cells. It also reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, which can improve cognitive function.</p>

      <h3>The Best Products to Help You Maintain Your Fast</h3>
      <p>Here are the products that have been essential for my fasting success:</p>

      <h4>1. La Colombe Cold Brew</h4>
      <img src="https://www.lacolombe.com/cdn/shop/files/RTD-9oz-2024_ColdBrew3.jpg?v=1736688124" alt="La Colombe Cold Brew" style="max-width:300px;border-radius:0.5rem;margin-bottom:1rem;" />
      <p><strong>Why it's perfect for fasting:</strong> Smooth, not bitter, and doesn't need any cream or sugar. The cold brew process makes it less acidic, so it's easier on an empty stomach. Plus, it's ready to drink‚Äîno brewing required when you're rushing out the door.</p>

      <h4>2. Cometeer Black Coffee</h4>
      <img src="https://cometeer.com/cdn/shop/files/slack-imgs.com.png?v=1727208980" alt="Cometeer Black Coffee" style="max-width:300px;border-radius:0.5rem;margin-bottom:1rem;" />
      <p><strong>Why it's perfect for fasting:</strong> These frozen coffee "pods" are made from flash-frozen, cold-brewed coffee. Just add hot water and you get a perfect cup of black coffee. No bitterness, no acidity, just pure coffee flavor. Perfect for when you need something quick and clean.</p>

      <h4>3. ST≈çK Cold Brew</h4>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTWs36XDk1EJsDwA-rKg3ViXBTud6D2Lxr8RQ&s" alt="ST≈çK Cold Brew" style="max-width:300px;border-radius:0.5rem;margin-bottom:1rem;" />
      <p><strong>Why it's perfect for fasting:</strong> Their "Low & Slow" brewing process creates a smooth, bold coffee that's perfect for fasting. I love their Extra Bold Black Cold Brew‚Äîit's strong enough to give you that morning kick without being harsh on an empty stomach. Plus, the 48oz bottles last forever.</p>

      <h3>The Honest Truth About the Challenges</h3>
      <p>It's not all sunshine and rainbows. Here's what I struggled with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The first week sucks:</strong> You'll be hungry, cranky, and probably want to quit. Push through‚Äîit gets easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Social situations:</strong> Breakfast meetings, brunch with friends, family dinners‚Äîyou'll need to be flexible or explain your eating schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>Not for everyone:</strong> If you have medical conditions, are pregnant, or have a history of eating disorders, fasting might not be right for you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Daily Routine (What Actually Works)</h3>
      <p>Here's my actual daily fasting routine after two years of dialing it in:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>5:30 AM:</strong> Wake up, drink water</li>
        <li><strong>5:35 AM:</strong> Black coffee (usually La Colombe or ST≈çK)</li>
        <li><strong>5:45 AM:</strong> Read the news with a clear mind</li>
        <li><strong>6:00 AM:</strong> Poop (let's be real, coffee works)</li>
        <li><strong>6:15 AM:</strong> Go for a run or workout</li>
        <li><strong>7:00 AM:</strong> Get ready and head to work</li>
        <li><strong>8:00 AM:</strong> Most productive work hours (still fasting, still focused)</li>
        <li><strong>10:00 AM:</strong> Second coffee if needed</li>
        <li><strong>12:00 PM:</strong> First meal (usually protein + healthy fats)</li>
        <li><strong>8:00 PM:</strong> Last meal of the day</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start gradually:</strong> Try 14:10 first, then work up to 16:8</li>
        <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Water, black coffee, and herbal tea are your friends</li>
        <li><strong>Don't break your fast with junk:</strong> Your first meal sets the tone for the day</li>
        <li><strong>Listen to your body:</strong> If you feel terrible, it's okay to eat</li>
        <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Your body adapts to routine</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Intermittent fasting isn't a magic bullet, but it's been a game-changer for my productivity and mental clarity. The combination of physiological benefits (fat burning, reduced inflammation) and psychological benefits (forced focus, simplified eating) has made it worth the initial adjustment period.</p>

      <p>If you're curious about trying it, start with the products I mentioned above. Good black coffee makes fasting so much easier. And remember‚Äîthe goal isn't perfection. Some days you'll break your fast early, and that's totally fine.</p>

      <h2>David Protein's New Cod Protein: The Review</h2>
      <img src="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/ext/resources/2025/07/17/Adobe-Express---file---2025-07-17T091533.644.webp?height=667&t=1752761799&width=1080" alt="David Protein Cod Product" style="max-width:100%;border-radius:0.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;" />
      <p><strong>Let‚Äôs get this out of the way:</strong> If you‚Äôre looking for a protein bar that tastes like a birthday cake, this is not it. If you want to feel like you just licked a Norwegian fishing boat, you‚Äôre in the right place.</p>
      <p>David Protein‚Äôs new <strong>Cod Protein</strong> is exactly what it says on the pack: clean, pure, straight-up cod. No artificial flavors, no sweeteners, no "hint of vanilla" to mask the fact that you are, in fact, eating fish. It‚Äôs protein for people who want results, not dessert.</p>
      <h3>Nutritional Benefits: Why Cod Protein?</h3>
      <p>Cod is one of the leanest, most protein-rich foods you can eat. Compared to tuna or salmon, cod has a higher protein-to-fat ratio, making it a great choice for anyone looking to maximize protein intake while keeping fat low. Each serving of David Protein Cod packs a punch of high-quality, complete protein with minimal calories and almost zero fat. If you‚Äôre serious about building muscle or just want a clean protein source, cod is hard to beat.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cod vs. Tuna:</strong> Cod has less mercury, less fat, and a milder flavor. Tuna is great, but cod is cleaner and lighter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cod vs. Salmon:</strong> Salmon is higher in healthy fats (omega-3s), but if you want pure protein, cod wins for leanness.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>First Impressions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Like a fish market at 7am. Not for the faint of heart.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Surprisingly good! No weird mush, just a firm, slightly oceanic bite.</li>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Pale, off-white. Looks innocent. Tastes... not innocent.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Taste Test</h3>
      <p>We tried it straight out of the pack (for science). The verdict? <em>It‚Äôs not bad, but it‚Äôs definitely not good in the way you think.</em> It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs pure, and it‚Äôs 100% cod. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to take a bite and then immediately go deep-sea fishing, this is your moment.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;margin:2rem 0;">
        <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcXpnbWNwMDlkNHEzaGJzMnh4em1qd3FjM2JkZnRpOXZhNm5uY2lmayZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/G5tA3ZSgiBiIo/giphy.gif" alt="Guy getting hit by a fish GIF" style="max-width:320px;border-radius:0.5rem;" />
        <div style="font-size:0.95em;color:#64748b;margin-top:0.5rem;">Eating this literally feels like getting hit in the face by a fish. But hey, that's how you know it's real.</div>
      </div>
      <p>With a little lemon and some herbs? Actually, not terrible. We‚Äôre not saying you should serve it at your next dinner party, but if you‚Äôre serious about protein and don‚Äôt care about taste, this is as real as it gets.</p>
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>David Protein‚Äôs Cod is for the hardcore. The no-nonsense. The ‚ÄúI eat for macros, not for fun‚Äù crowd. If you want to impress your gym bros or just want to tell people you ate a cod, this is your new go-to.</p>
      <p><strong>Would we eat it again?</strong> ...Maybe. But only if we‚Äôre feeling particularly jacked and a little bit nautical.</p>
      <p><em>Stay tuned for next week‚Äôs digest, where we try something that hopefully doesn‚Äôt taste like the Atlantic.</em></p>
